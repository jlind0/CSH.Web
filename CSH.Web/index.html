                    In physical space a body provides direct assertion for identification. In cyberspace a unique digital body is required to provide direct assertion as well, an IsoNuclei. Just like a body arrives at a physical bank, an IsoNuclei arrives at the digital bank. Both a body and an IsoNuclei exist independent of secondary identification credentials making them a unique factor.
                </p><p>
                    Cyber security is at a crossroads. In a binary environment one fork is continuing indirect assertion of identity. It has a historical record of inadequacy. The other fork is direct assertion of identity with a digital body, an IsoNuclei.
                </p><p>
                    An IsoNuclei based security model creates a unique secure execution environment as a base of operation. Within that environment secure activity is performed, a virtual digital SCIF.
                </p><p>
                    Think of the possibilities with an IsoNuclei.  An IsoNuclei can be used at any time from any device without leaving a footprint. An access control model basing usage on the presence of a digital body will substantially enhance the performance of other deployed cyber security solutions.
                </p><p>
                    An IsoNuclei provides a unique second factor at the endpoint AND the point-of-authentication, true two-unique-factor-based secure activity.
                </p><p>
                    Cyberspace with an IsoNuclei is the next frontier!

                    The solution on the left is a next-generation
                    implemention of CSH’s original co-located plan. In
                    this CSH’s Authentication Services are deployed
                    on Azure, first in a Virtual Machine and later as
                    true PaaS solution where private authentication
                    providers can deployed.The client then has
                    deployment in Azure including a Proxy specifically
                    designed to talk to the authentication services and
                    relay web application back to the IsoNuclei. 
                    </p><p>
                    Behind the proxy will sit a VNET that
                    connects Site-to-Site with the client’s physical
                    infrastructure for the proxy to access. The Proxy
                    will be a packaged network component so that the
                    client can be deployed, and marketed, under a
                    true IaaS model.
