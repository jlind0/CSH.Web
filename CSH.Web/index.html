                    solution in this area is that they are only One-Factor when used on the Internet. When secure activity
                    was introduced to the internet the recommendation was to use two unique factors. This would inconvenience
                    customers from using websites, so the term multi-factor was introduced to mask the decision not to follow
                    the most basic security protocol.</p>

                    environment there must also be two or more factors for a multi-factor model to be valid, however, currently
                    only data is presented. Data is only One-Factor, because of this corruption of the English language I
                    have described the process as proof-of-presence.

        <p>Multi-factor authentication when properly implemented is only half the problem into securing the cyberspace domain:
            Ensuring data is not accessible without true establishment of presence is key to maintaining access of control
            over digital system and information systems.</p>
        <p>Our patented solution combines Hardware Unique Factor technology in etching complex signature into silicon, this
            by way of chip - cannot be replicated. The Secure Execution Environment, which isolates secure information delivered
            from client servers onto external memory modules prevents access from rouge processes - while naturally destroying
            any trace of the session once USB IsoNuclei are removed from machine/computer.</p>

    <section class="CSH-quantum-leap secure">
        <p>Cyber Safety Harbor (CSH)’s products are a quantum leap in securing sensitive transactions on the Internet. Our patented
            system engages a new mindset in security; instead of reactive “patch-and-repair,” CSH takes a new approach of
            reducing the universe of users, then engaging security before the portal is created, not after as is current
            methodology. This “disruptive technology” with incredible market potential. The primary product hardware, IsoNuclei,
            currently in USB form factor, contains both a Hardware Unique Factor (HUF) and a Secure Execution Environment
            (SEE) used to establish PRESENCE over cyber.</p>
        <p>Originally designed for US Military Command and Control, CSH holds the patent on SimulNuclei which defines a set
            of IsoNucleis with authorization to perform a set of actions and then a subset of those whose presence must be
            established in order to perform one of those actions.Our HUF is an Atmel encrypted chip that is theortically
            physically impossible to duplicate once etched meaning, once registered with CSH’s authentication services, only
            that specific IsoNuclei has the ability to authenticate. SEE’s enable software to run in the memory space on
            the IsoNuclei itself, not on the Host OS, and therefore, since nothing is in RAM on the underlying computer,
            once the IsoNuclei is removed the session implodes and not only does the user lose access to the application
            but also there is no evidence of their session on the host computer, since there was none to begin with.

                <h3>Applications in the Legal Field</h3>
                <p>The initial market for IsoNuclei is projected to be Law Firms, particularly those in Mergers & Acquisitions.
                    M&A Firms have increasingly been targeted for their documents, which are regularly accessible through
                    “secure” web portals that this technology would eliminate. The cost-benefit ratio is high here as a single
                    leak could costs billions and implementing this solution on top of something like SharePoint is trivial
                    from both a technical and logistics standpoint.</p>

                <h3>Applications in Private Banking
                </h3>
                <p>In private banking SimulNuclei could be applied to account actions like wire transfers where both the account
                    holder and a banker both need to establish presence, perhaps the banker even at a physical location.
                    This maintains the human authentication element many banks now require for some transactions while the
                    transactions remain available in cyberspace.</p>

                The solution pictured here is a next-generation implemention of CSH’s original co-located plan. In this CSH’s Authentication
                Services are deployed on Azure, first in a Virtual Machine and later as true PaaS solution where private
                authentication providers can deployed.The client then has deployment in Azure including a Proxy specifically
                designed to talk to the authentication services and relay web application back to the IsoNuclei.
            </p>
            <p>
                Behind the proxy will sit a VNET that connects Site-to-Site with the client’s physical infrastructure for the proxy to access.
                The Proxy will be a packaged network component so that the client can be deployed, and marketed, under a
                true IaaS model.
