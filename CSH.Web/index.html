                <p>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) - Is in fact Multi-Factor Authentication and the reality of every solution in this area is that they are only One-Factor when used on the Internet. When secure activity was introduced to the internet the recommendation was to use two unique factors. This would inconvenience customers from using websites, so the term multi-factor was introduced to mask the decision not to follow the most basic security protocol.</p>
                <p>
                    ‘Today Multi-Factor’ and ‘Two-Factor’ have come to mean a process the gathers data in multiple
                    steps at the endpoint and transfers the data to a secure environment for authentication. At the secure
                    environment there must also be two or more factors for a multi-factor model to be valid, however,
                    currently only data is presented. Data is only One-Factor, because of this corruption of the English
                    language I have described the process as proof-of-presence.

                    The solution on the left is a next-generation
                    implemention of CSH’s original co-located plan. In
                    this CSH’s Authentication Services are deployed
                    on Azure, first in a Virtual Machine and later as
                    true PaaS solution where private authentication
                    providers can deployed.The client then has
                    deployment in Azure including a Proxy specifically
                    designed to talk to the authentication services and
                    relay web application back to the IsoNuclei. 
                    </p><p>
                    Behind the proxy will sit a VNET that
                    connects Site-to-Site with the client’s physical
                    infrastructure for the proxy to access. The Proxy
                    will be a packaged network component so that the
                    client can be deployed, and marketed, under a
                    true IaaS model.
