                <b>In physical space a body provides direct assertion for identification.</b> In cyberspace a unique digital
                body is required to provide direct assertion as well, an IsoNuclei. Just like a body arrives at a physical
                bank, an IsoNuclei arrives at the digital bank. Both a body and an IsoNuclei exist independent of secondary
                identification credentials making them a unique factor.
                <br>
                <br> Cyber security is at a crossroads. In a binary environment one fork is continuing indirect assertion of
                identity. It has a historical record of inadequacy. The other fork is direct assertion of identity with a
                digital body, an IsoNuclei.
            </p>
            <h3>
                An IsoNuclei based security model creates a unique secure execution environment as a base of operation. Within that environment
                secure activity is performed, a virtual digital SCIF.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Think of the possibilities with an IsoNuclei that can be used at any time from any device without leaving a footprint. An
                access control model basing usage on the presence of a digital body will substantially enhance the performance
                of other deployed cyber security solutions. An IsoNuclei provides a unique second factor at the endpoint
                AND the point-of-authentication, true two-unique-factor-based secure activity.

                Authentication based on a state of “being” using a digital body provides a method to ensure data is not accessible without true establishment of presence. The key to maintaining access of control over digital system and information systems is requiring verification of presence from secure activity.

                Our patented solution combines Hardware Unique Factor technology  based on a serialized manufactured chip that cannot be replicated. The Secure Execution Environment, which isolates secure information delivered from client servers onto a external memory module prevents access from rouge processes - while naturally destroying any trace of the session once the IsoNuclei is removed from device/computer.

                Cyber Safety Harbor (CSH)’s products are a quantum leap in securing sensitive transactions on the Internet. Our patented system engages a new mindset in security. CSH takes a new approach of reducing the universe of users, then engaging security before the portal is created, not after data is received as is current methodology. The primary product hardware, IsoNuclei, currently in USB form factor, contains both a Hardware Unique Factor (HUF) and a Secure Execution Environment (SEE) used to establish PRESENCE over cyber.

                Originally designed for US Military Command and Control, CSH holds the patent on SimulNuclei that are a set of IsoNucleis. This model requires two or more IsoNuclei be present to perform an action. Dubbed our “firing solution", this system requires more than one IsoNuclei be present to approve any action for execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our HUF uses an Atmel encrypted chip that is theoretically physically impossible to duplicate. This means once registered with CSH’s authentication services, each IsoNuclei authenticates a specific individual. SEE enables software to run in the memory space on the IsoNuclei itself, not on the Host OS. Therefore, since nothing is cached on the underlying computer, once the IsoNuclei is removed, the session data evaporates. Not only does the Session data disappear but there is also no evidence the session every existed on the host computer

                    <h3>Applications in the Legal Field</h3>
                    <p>One of our initial markets for IsoNuclei is the legal profession, particularly those in Mergers & Acquisitions. M&A Firms have been increasingly targeted for their documents. These documents are currently accessible through “secure” web portals providing a bullseye for hackers. IsoNuclei technology would eliminate the need for public access and identify the individual before presenting an access method. The cost-benefit ratio is high because a single leak could cost the deal. Implementing IsoNuclei technology on top of something like SharePoint is easily accomplished.</p>

                    The solution pictured here is a next-generation cloud implementation of CSH’s original co-located model. The cloud-based CSH’s Authentication Services are deployed on Azure as a PaaS solution where private authentication providers can deploy. The client then has deployment in Azure including a Proxy specifically designed to talk to the authentication services and relay web applications back to the IsoNuclei.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Behind the proxy sits a VNET that connects Site-to-Site with the client’s physical infrastructure for the proxy to access. The Proxy is a packaged network component so that the client can be deployed as a true IaaS model.
